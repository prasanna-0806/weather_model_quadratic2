# Weather Modelling Using Quadratic Equation  

## Overview  
A simple weather prediction system built with Python using a **quadratic model** to approximate temperature trends. Demonstrates development with **Waterfall**, **Iterative**, and **Agile (Scrum)** models.  

## Features  
- Predicts **temperature, humidity, rainfall** trends  
- Provides:  
  - Hourly forecasts  
  - Daily summaries  
  - Graphical outputs (Matplotlib)  
  - Extreme condition alerts  

## Requirements  
- **Software**: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib  
- **Hardware**: Cloud/local system with storage & computation  

## Development Models  

### 1. Waterfall  
Sequential phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance  
- Outputs graphs for **actual vs. hypothetical data**  

### 2. Iterative  
Each iteration adds features:  
1. Fixed coefficients input/output  
2. User input for coefficients  
3. File I/O  
4. Simple UI  
5. Error handling  

### 3. Agile (Scrum)  
Work in short sprints:  
- **Sprint 1**: Repo setup, I/O  
- **Sprint 2**: User input  
- **Sprint 3**: File I/O + unit tests  
- **Sprint 4**: GUI/CLI  
- **Sprint 5**: Final testing & deployment  

## Results  
- Quadratic model generated weather curves  
- **Actual data** → realistic day/night temperature patterns  
- **Hypothetical data** → less accurate  

## Conclusion  
The project shows how a quadratic equation can approximate temperature trends.  
Different SDLC models provided structured and flexible development approaches.
